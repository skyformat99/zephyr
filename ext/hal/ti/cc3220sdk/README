The CC3220 SDK provides a peripheral driver library and hardware
register access header files for the Texas Instruments SimpleLink
CC3220S and CC3220SF SoCs.

The current version supported in Zephyr is CC3220 SDK 1.30.01.03,
downloaded from:

	http://www.ti.com/tool/download/SIMPLELINK-CC3220-SDK

A subset of the files in driverlib/ and inc/ are copied from a
Linux CC3220 SDK installation without modification.

TI provides the driver library functions burned into ROM at the factory,
or updated via a service pack patch, thus saving application code space.

Calling driverlib APIs prefixed by "MAP_" will vector to those functions
already existing in ROM.

For the zephyr shell sample, for example, using these ROM functions
results in a savings of about 2Kb in code space.

After setting CONFIG_HAS_CC3220SDK=y in Kconfig, most of the
peripheral driver library functions will be accessible from ROM,
except for the following modules:
- driverlib/prcm.c
- driverlib/utils.c
